HeavyWater Machine Learning Problem





An algorithmic approach for Document classification model.






Approached this Problem with Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, LogisticRegression Classifiers and found out RFC to be the best Classifier.






Used Random Classification Model trained on 70% of the data resulting in 87% effeciency.
