HeavyWater Machine Learning Problem





An algorithmic approach for Document classification model.






Approached this Problem with Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, LogisticRegression Classifiers and found out RFC to be the best Classifier.






Then used Random Classification Model with Best Paramaters, resulting in 87% effeciency.
